"""DaouOffice Messenger Bot — REST polling engine.

This is the single polling implementation used by :class:`daouoffice.DaouBot`.
It periodically lists rooms and, for any room whose newest message id is past
the per-room cursor, dispatches only messages newer than the last one it has
handled (tracked by ``chatMessageId``). The cursor — not the unread badge,
which the bot itself clears via ``mark_read`` — decides what is pending.

On first contact with a room the existing backlog is **not** replayed — a
baseline is set so the bot only reacts to messages that arrive while it is
running. The bot's own messages are skipped via the identity resolved at login.

Rooms are dispatched **concurrently across rooms, serial within a room**: a
slow handler in one room no longer stalls other rooms or the poll loop. The
at-least-once / ordered guarantees are unchanged — a room still advances its
cursor (and ``mark_read``) only after its handler succeeds; a room with a
handler still in flight is simply skipped until it finishes.

Polling is the only delivery mechanism. A WebSocket/STOMP endpoint
(``GET /ws/pc``) was observed in the traffic capture but its flow was never
validated, so it is intentionally not implemented (see docs/api/04-websocket.md).

    """REST polling bot engine.

    Delivery is **at-least-once** (the message-delivery industry standard):
    a message is re-delivered until its handler returns without raising,
    processed in order per room. This is not configurable — make handlers
    idempotent if a duplicate reply would matter. For fire-and-forget, have
    the handler swallow its own errors (it then never "fails", so it is not
    retried).

    Args:
        client: A logged-in :class:`BotClient`.
        on_message: Async callback invoked per inbound message.
        poll_interval: Seconds between poll cycles.
        cursors: Where to persist the per-room processed cursor. Defaults to
            an in-memory store (not durable across restarts); pass a
            :class:`~daouoffice.state.FileCursorStore` to resume after restart.
        max_attempts: give up on a single message after this many failed
            handler attempts and move on (poison-message guard).
        room_filter: Optional predicate applied to rooms before history fetch
            and read acknowledgements. Host apps can use this to enforce an
            allowlist at the transport boundary.
        markdown: render each handler reply from Markdown to the chat-HTML
            subset (bold/italic/lists) before sending. Off by default —
            replies are sent verbatim.
